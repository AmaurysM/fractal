## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Authentication:** NextAuth
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI
- **Hosting:** Vercel
- **Domain:** Namecheap

## 🏗️ Architecture

Voronoi follows a clean separation of responsibilities:

- **Next.js** — routing, rendering, and application structure
- **NextAuth** — authentication and identity management
- **Supabase** — data persistence and backend services
- **Zustand** — client-side state and UI logic

This structure keeps the app maintainable while allowing features to scale without rewrites.
